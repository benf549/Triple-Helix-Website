			<h4>Jerry Yang - Fall 2020</h4>
			<hr />

			<p id="first">
				A couple years ago, screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (best known for his work on <em>The Social Network</em>)
				worked on a short HBO television series called <em>The Newsroom</em> featuring the daily goings-on of a
				media company. On one such episode, a deputy EPA administrator is interviewed and asked about the impact
				of climate change. In a resigned voice, he answers:
			</p>
			<p class="indented">
				&ldquo;Well, mass migrations, food and water shortages, spread of deadly disease,
				endless wildfires
				&ndash; way too many to keep under control, [and] storms that have the power to level cities&rdquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				At the time of writing, the National Weather Service has begun using Greek letters to name our
				hurricanes
				(we already used up the normal alphabet) and it isn&rsquo;t an exaggeration to say that California is
				burning. This quote reads less like chicken-little and more like a filled out bingo card. One of these
				predictions, though, stands out from the others. <strong>Covid-19 may seem like a once in a generation
					freak occurrence but the extensive impacts of climate change have made pandemics not a matter of if
					but a matter of when</strong>. Natural events are more often than not related to one another &ndash;
				something to consider when fighting both this virus and the next one.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Understanding how the coronavirus pandemic began is a good place to start. Phylogenic analyses conclude
				that 2019-nCoV is most closely related to diseases found in bats and were likely transmitted from bat
				carriers to an unknown intermediate mammal host and then onto humans. The initial spreading event has by
				now been traced back to the Wuhan South China Seafood Market where a variety of wild animals are sold.
				The general scientific consensus is that the close proximity of a diverse array of wild animals to human
				beings was what allowed for the rise of the zoonotic 2019-nCoV disease<sup>1</sup>. This is far from the
				first time this has happened. The various lineages of HIV have each been traced back to independent
				cross-species transmission between humans and non-human primates in West Africa as a result of human
				bush hunters eating chimps infected with recombinant strains of SIV well suited to human
				infection<sup>2</sup>. The destruction of natural habitats via simultaneous climate change and
				deforestation is only accelerating this process. Unchecked development and urbanization pushes both wild
				animals and human beings closer increasing the chances for a zoonotic event to occur. At the same time,
				climate change disrupts the natural balance of things. Species are pushed out of their habitats and into
				contact with other species allowing for viruses to spread between the two and merge into deadlier
				diseases. Livelihoods are destabilized from droughts or natural disasters pushing people into hunting
				for wild game for their next meal<sup>3</sup>.

					Comparison between cases per capita and PM2.5 pollution levels in the Netherlands &ndash;

				</em>
			</p>
			<hr />
			<p>
				On a separate but related note, climate change and related human activities have not only given rise to
				the virus but have actively increased its severity. Since Covid-19 is a respiratory disease, it stands
				to reason that ambient air pollution would play a role in its lethality. There is little data to go off
				of right now, recent studies have found that air pollution tracks with Covid-19 deaths in the United
				States to an extremely large degree<sup>4</sup>. This is unfortunately yet another way in which the
				brunt of the pandemic is disproportionately felt by communities of color and those of lower
				socioeconomic status who tend to live in areas where environmental regulation has taken a back seat to
				industrial development. While this may be the most visible way in which pollution shapes Covid-19
				lethality, it certainly isn&rsquo;t the only way. Diseases are normally limited to spreading within
				areas of a certain climate. Malaria, for instance, can only survive in tropical places where mosquitos
				are able to lay eggs in pools of stagnant water. Shifting climates as a result of climate change,
				however, mean that climate-restricted diseases are able to infect places they otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t
				have access to. In particular, the area in which people are at risk for malarial infection is already
				creeping northward. Even more worrisome is the idea that global warming may be spurring some pathogens
				to evolve higher heat resistance<sup>5</sup>. One of the first lines of defense the human immune system
				has is sparking a fever to increase body temperature and kill off infection. Widespread heat resistance
				renders such an approach unusable. Climate change is making us weaker in ways we never could have seen
				coming.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				As a final point, let&rsquo;s take a step away from the Covid-19 pandemic and travel to the northern
				latitudes. Rising global temperatures have resulted in the shrinking of glaciers and the melting of the
				arctic permafrost which, strangely enough, has major ramifications for the future of public health. 75
				years ago, a reindeer was killed by anthrax bacteria in a remote corner of Russia and the corpse was
				frozen beneath the arctic permafrost. In 2016, a heat wave melted the ice allowing intact infections
				spores to spread and kicking off a major outbreak of anthrax. Other researchers have looked into the
				arctic ice and were shocked to see massive frozen ancient viruses with very little in common with their
				more modern cousins. Our immune systems having never been exposed to these pathogens, humanity would be
				caught even more off guard should a particularly deadly virus awake from its frozen slumber. These are
				not the plot of some movie but rather real problems created by climate change. Epidemiologists are
				already preparing for the day a corpse infected with smallpox is unfrozen, reanimating humanity&rsquo;s
				most deadly rival.

			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Helped along by climate change and related human activities, the next waves of pandemics are coming. The
				Covid-19 pandemic is not an outlier but rather a sign of things yet to come. More than a million dead
				have been counted with more yet to come. Nonetheless, humanity now more than ever is aware and informed
				of the disastrous effects of disregarding the environment. Climate change is a speeding car heading off
				a cliff and humanity is asleep at the wheel. If there&rsquo;s any silver lining to the harsh reality of
				this pandemic is that our alarm clock just went off.
