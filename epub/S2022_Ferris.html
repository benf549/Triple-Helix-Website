			<h1>The Orphan Drug Act</h1>
			<h6>A legacy of fostering revolutionary policies, or an issue abandoned?</h6>

			<p>More than 25 million Americans live with rare diseases [1]. Although "orphan" conditions are rare and
				affect fewer than 200,000 patients individually, their cumulative impact leaps to 300 million patients
				worldwide [2, 3]. These diseases are "orphaned" conditions because, without government intervention,
				they are abandoned by pharmaceutical companies. Companies have no incentive to research, manufacture, or
				patent orphan treatments given the small market for each disease.
			</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p>To combat the poor supply of treatments, the United States passed the Orphan Drug Act (ODA) in 1983. This
				Act provided numerous financial benefits to companies who produced orphan drugs. But, as the number of
				approved orphan drugs grows, many believe that the Act is being exploited, making orphan drug
				development a predatory financial opportunity rather than a philanthropic motivator.
			</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p>So, if orphan drugs target groups under 200,000 people, they must be substantially capped on potential
				profits, right? Not exactly. </p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p>Due to the ODA, clinical trials for orphan drugs have more flexible FDA standards, which makes their
				trials more likely to be nonrandomized with smaller sample sizes. While smaller trials are anticipated
				due to the scarcity of patients with orphan diseases, the net result for companies is a development
				process costing less than half of that for typical drugs [4]. This, in addition to a 50% tax credit, a
				seven year market exclusivity period, fee waivers, and increased numbers of grants, makes it clear how
				the ODA entices companies [5].
			</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p>On top of these obvious benefits, the ODA doesn't restrict how many orphan designations a single drug can
				get. If a single drug treats multiple conditions, that drug can gain a new orphan status for each
				condition and, subsequently, acquire all accompanying benefits. For instance, treatments like
				"interferon, somatropin and levocarnitine [...] can obtain up to 33 orphan designations each'' [6].
				Hence, drugs that are initially thought to treat small populations and receive benefits compensating for
				this scale often have a reach far larger than the 200,000 person cap.
			</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p>Beyond multiple orphan designations, drugs can be granted orphan status while also treating multiple
				common diseases. A prime example of this is Rituximab, which was first an orphan-designated drug for
				follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but became the "fourth best-selling drug in the world in 2014"
				because it also treats several more common afflictions [7].
			</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p>Another more recent example is Adalimumab, an orphan drug which treats tumor necrosis which, in 2018,
				rocketed to be "the [US's] top-selling prescription drug with $13.7 billion in sales" [8]. Of course, a
				majority of its profits came from its non-orphan disease applications. These two examples are nothing
				out of the ordinary. Drugs with orphan designations often form a considerable portion of the top
				best-selling drugs each year, despite their supposedly small scope [9].
			</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p>While some of these broader scopes may be happy coincidences discovered during development, there are
				undoubtedly companies that intentionally try to pass off a drug that primarily treats common conditions
				as an orphan drug. This was demonstrated in 2020 when Remedesivir, a drug that treats the COVID-19
				virus, was granted orphan designation because, at the time of initial application in 2019, there were
				sufficiently few cases [8]. Today, the ODA benefits that were intended for drugs that treat small
				populations are actualized for drugs with much larger scopes.
			</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p>But companies taking advantage of orphan drug designations aren't even the largest problem with the
				ODA - the prices are.
			</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p>The average cost of the most commonly sold orphan drugs in 2014 was $137,782 yearly per patient, but for
				comparable non-orphan drugs it was only $20,875 [7]. If this is jointly considered with the seven year
				exclusivity benefit that the ODA provides and the lack of generic alternatives, patients are left with
				little choice but to find ways to cover the exorbitant costs for treatments.
			</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p>Half of those diagnosed with orphan diseases are under the age of 18 [3]. Consequently, the cost-burden
				for treatments often lies with the patients' caretakers, or rather with their insurance companies. In
				the US, where health insurance can cost fortunes and orphan-designated drugs face more coverage
				restrictions, this is especially problematic [10].
			</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p>Coverage varies from drug to drug and from insurance policy to insurance policy. While some drugs may be
				completely covered, even 'small' percentages of medical benefit costs can result in thousands per month
				in out-of-pocket fees [11]. Orphan drugs are often included in the highest copay categories by health
				plans like Medicare and, over time, co-insurance and copayment costs are only expected to increase [12].
			</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p>Make no mistake, the ODA is a revolutionary piece of government legislature that has improved the lives
				of millions. However, the number of orphan drug designations is increasing, with no definite limits on
				price. It is vital that these issues are brought to light. The first step towards a solution, which may
				include price caps or closing designation loopholes, is acknowledging that improvements are not just
				possible, but necessary.
